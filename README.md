# shenbot-discord
simple personal discord bot coded in python using the discord.py python library.

library doc: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#

tokens and channel ids are within the .env file.

I opted for an easy access file for quick dev turnaround and testing.
Actual use would be to store the bot token in an environment variable 
or other secrets location.
